Anilyze version 1.5

A huerisitical program that calculates the average nucleotide index of various genomes

This software was made to analyze whether or not certain bacterial taxonomic trees should be revised based off of the output of this program when run with all complete genomes or 16S RNA files from NCBI

Prerequisite software: Python 2.7, Mac OSX or a Linux Operating System, GCC compiler, Biopython

How to run software from README directory: 
>python setup.py -i <Directory of .fna or .fasta files> 
>python setup.py -d
>python setup.py -r
-d flag will automatically download and setup all complete genomes from NCBI location
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/doc/ftpfaq/
-r flag will run setup on files located in ./inputFiles
-i flag example: python anilyze.py -i /Users/user/desktop/fnaFilesLocation/
Example Files: /path/Examplo_Bacterii.fna and /path/Examplus_Bacterium.fna
Files from setup will be found in ./directoryGiven/correctlyFormatted/
>cd C
>make
>anilyzeExeC <locationOfFilesRanFromSetup> <kmerSize> <fileSimilarityThreshold> <An integer greater than or equal to the number of files found in ./directoryGiven/correctlyFormatted/>
