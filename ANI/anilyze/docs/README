Anilyze version 1.5

A huerisitical program that calculates the average nucleotide index of various genomes

This software was made to analyze whether or not certain bacterial taxonomic trees should be revised based off of the output of this program when run with all complete genomes or 16S RNA files from NCBI

Prerequisite software: Python 2.7, Mac OSX or a Linux Operating System, GCC compiler, Biopython

How to run software from README directory:
>cd anilyze
>python setup.py -h
usage: setup.py [-h] [-e] [-a]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e, --executeWithDefaultInputDirectory
                        Execute with .fna or .fasta files in
                        ./anilyze/inputFiles
  -a, --autoDownloadNCBIComplete
                        Automatically download files and execute with NCBI
                        complete bacteria DNA files
>cd C
>make
>anilyzeExeC <locationOfFilesRanFromSetup> <kmerSize> <fileSimilarityThreshold> <An integer greater than or equal to the number of files found in ./directoryGiven/correctlyFormatted/>
