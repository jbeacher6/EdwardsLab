This is a Python library to calculate average nucleotide identities using a range of different methods.

The different methods are blastn(BLAST) and nucmer(MUMmer). 
Currently, nucmer algorithm is assumed to be working(tests to verify correctness will take place) 
The blastn ANI algorithm is currently not working correctly.

The most current and applicable program is aniGUI.py

------------------------------
Operating System Requirements
------------------------------
Linux or OS X Operating System
(Tested on OS X)

MUMmer3.10 has been tested successfully on:

- Redhat Linux 6.2, 7.3   (Pentium 4)
- Compaq Tru64 UNIX 5.1   (alpha)
- SunOS UNIX 5.8          (sparc)
- Mac OS X 10.2.8         (PowerPC G4)


--------------------------------
Installed Software Requirements
--------------------------------

- Python version 2.7 or greater

   The MUMmer3.x package requires the following to run successfully. In the
absence of one or more of these utilities, certain MUMmer programs may fail
to run correctly. Listed in parenthesis are the versions used to test the
MUMmer package. These versions, or subsequent versions should assure the proper
execution of the various MUMmer programs. These utilities must be accessible
via the system path:

- make (GNU make 3.79.1)
- perl (PERL     5.6.0)
- sh   (GNU sh   1.14.7)
- csh  (tcsh     6.10.00)
- g++  (GNU gcc  2.95.3)
- sed  (GNU sed  3.02)
- awk  (GNU awk  3.0.4)
- ar   (GNU ar   2.9.5)

BLAST version 2.2.29 or higher
--------------------------------
Directions:
1. Download ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/ncbi-blast-2.6.0+.dmg
  
  a. ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/
  
  b. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/news/1-7-2014-blast-2-2-29/
  
2. Check md5: 19397736eafbb9e42d6541dc2797523a  ncbi-blast-2.6.0+.dmg

3. Right click and open ncbi-blast-2.6.0+.dmg
  
  a. If one double clicks the left mousepad twice to open, it will probably not install because of default permissions
4.

MUMmer version 3.23 or higher
------------------------------
Directions:
1. Download MUMmer (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mummer/files/mummer/3.23/MUMmer3.23.tar.gz/stats/timeline)
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mummer/files/mummer/
2. Check md5: ?

In terminal:
3. "cd Users/YourUsername/"

4. "mkdir MUMmer3.x"
5. "cd MUMmer3.x"
6. "open Users/YourUsername/MUMmer3.x"
7. "tar -xvzf MUMmer3.x"
8. "su" (or append sudo to the beginning of 8 and 9) [tested with "su"]
9. "make check"
10. "make install"
11. MUMmer 3.x should now be installed properly
  a. Try entering ./nucmer to test if installation worked. If a reply of "not found" shows, it was probably not installed correctly 

------------------
File Requirements
------------------
Directions:
1. Download ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/archive/old_refseq/Bacteria/all.fna.tar.gz 
2. Unzip all.fna
3. In terminal:
	(Tested)
	a.Change directory to aniGUI.py
	b.Inputpython aniGUI.py
or
	(Not Tested)
	a. Double click on aniGUI.py
4. A GUI should open


----------------
GUI Directions
----------------

Left Buttons
------------
These optional buttons can help the user open directories and input the correct directory location names in the middle red boxes

Middle Red Boxes
----------------
- Red Box 1(Top box):
Input directory location of all.fna or use left box to point to it and the program will fill out the directory location name for you.
- Red Box 2:
Input directory location of the installed BLAST directory or use left box to point to it and the program will fill out the directory location name for you.
- Red Box 3(Middle box):
Input location of the installed MUMMer directory or use left box to point to it and the program will fill out the directory location name for you.
- Red Box 4:
Input location where to save delta files from MUMMer output, or use left box to point to it and the program will fill out the directory location name for you.
- Red Box 5(Bottom Box):
Input location where to save percent ANI files from ANI output, or use left box to point to it and the program will fill out the directory location name for you.

Right Check Boxes
------------------
- Reformat, rename and concatenate:
(Tested, complete)
Prerequisite: Downloaded all.fna
When checked, this will reformat, rename and concatenate all.fna to be able to be used later in the program. 
This concatinates multiple .fna files into one, deletes the other multiple .fna files and renames the one .fna file to the same name as its parent, without calling it junior

- Move modified files to Blast/MUMmer Directories:
(Tested, complete)
Prerequisite: Ran Reformat, rename and concatinate option on all.fna
When checked, this will move the reformatted, renamed and concatinated all.fna files to the directories specified in Red Box 2 and Red Box 3

- Execute Blast:
(Not completed)
When checked, this will call blastn on the files in the respective directory specified in Red Box 2

- Execute MUMmer:
(Not complete)
When checked, this will call nucmer on the files in the respective directory specified in Red Box 3

- Create output for SQLite:
(Not complete)
When checked, this will create a statement to create a SQL lite database respective to the output generated by this program

- Create output for JSON:
(Not complete)
When checked, this will create a statement to create a JSON seed respective to the output generated by this program


----------------
Test Information
----------------
Test case documenation will be available at a further date


----------------------------
Current Bugs or Known Issues
----------------------------
1. Directories with spaces do not work correctly

   a. For example, /Users/jon/Desktop/all fna will not work correctly, but /Users/jon/Desktop/all.fna will work
   
2. If the user has checked Move modified files to Blast/MUMmer Directories, the directory should not already exist. 

   a. If the directory without children exists, the program will delete it. 
   
   b. If there are any children to the specified parent, unknown behavior will happen as it has not been tested yet.
   
3. User must select all.fna in the first Red Box or the reformat, rename and concatenate program will not work correctly 

4. First line of each FNA file isnt removed. Will work on fixing this important issue
