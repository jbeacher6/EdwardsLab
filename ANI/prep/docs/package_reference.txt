def downloadFiles(inputDirectoryParam, testParam):
#This will download the complete bacterial files via ftp with file extensions of .fna.gz from refseq
#Details and more information can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/doc/ftpfaq/#asmsumfiles
#Parameter inputDirectoryParam: the directory to download the .fna.gz files from refseq

def decompress(inputDirectoryParam):
#This will decompress all files that end in .fna.gz with gunzip
#Parameter inputDirectoryParam: the directory containing all of the respecive .fna.gz files to decompress

def deleteFirstLineAndRename(inputDirectoryParam):
#This will delete the first line and reanme the file according to the information contained in the fna file >NC000 Examplii Exli will rename to Examplii_Exli.fna
#This will override duplicate fnas with the same name(delete and add only new fna file)
#Parameter inputDirectoryParam: the directory containing all of the respective fna files to rename

def createReverseComplimentAndAppendToForward(inputDirectoryParam):
#Step 4: Create the reverse compliment of the fna file and concatinate to the forward fna file
#TODO: Modify to become in place
#This will create a reverse compliment of the dna(fna) files location in the input directory parameter and concatinate it to the forward of the dna file into a new file located in the tree/outputDirectoryParam/complete/complete/ directory
#Anilyze in C will use the reverse compliment to compute ANI
#Parameter inputDirectoryParam is the location of all of the forward .fna files

def convertToBinary(inputDirectoryParam):
#TODO: Create an in place algortihm and add U, N RNA to DNA conversions that are not A,C,G and T
#Step 5: Convert the forward and reverse complimented file to a custom binary code
#This will turn the forward fna file and the reverse complimented fna file into a custom binary code of A(00), C(01), G(10), T(11) 
#Reformat and rename list of fna files
#Parameter inputDirectoryParam: location of forward and reverse complimented concatinated fna files

def deleteLineInfo(inputDirectoryParam):
#This will delete all lines that contain >NC. This is done because certain complete .fna files have many of these lines that need to be deleted
#Parameter inputDirectoryParam: the directory containing all of the respective fna files to delete the >NC lines

def modifyLineLengthToSeventy(inputDirectoryParam, outputDirectoryParam):
#This will modify the line length to 70. Anilyze in C needs a constant line length with new lines
#Paramter inputDirectoryParam: the directory of the files that contain the files to modify the line length to seventy
#Parameter outputDirectoryParam: the directory of the modifed line length files

def deletePreviousFiles(inputDirectoryParam):
  shutil.rmtree(inputDirectoryParam)
#This will delete the leftover files that were completed in progress
#Parameter inputDirectoryParam: the directory containing all of the respective files to delete

def splitFasta(inputFileParam):
#Parameter inputFileParam: The fasta file to split
#Parameter outputFileParam: The directory to output the .fna file to output to
