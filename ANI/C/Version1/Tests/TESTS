Test Case 1
-----------
K-mers are accurate from .fna file
Input: 5mers.fna
Expected Result: CTGAT TGATC GATCG ATCGA TCGAT CGATC 
Output: CTGAT TGATC GATCG ATCGA TCGAT CGATC 
Result: PASS

Test Case 2
------------
K-mer can have wide rage of values
Input: K-mer value of 2, 5, 8, 10, 65, 66, 70, 80
Exepcted Result: All k-mers remain same size
Output: k-mers 2-65 remain the same, and 66+ have k-mer values above 1000
Result: Pass with reservation

EdwardsLab

Code from the Edwards lab, including bioinformatics, image analysis and more. All this code is created and maintained by folks at Rob Edwards' bioinformatics lab at SDSU.

For more information about the Edwards' lab see http://edwards.sdsu.edu/research.

We use this repository to share our code and data with each other, and with the world.

We make all this code available to everyone to use. If you find errors or bugs please let Rob Edwards know ... see the above URL for contact information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run:
Each library in terminal:
>gcc -o <LIBRARY_NAME>.o -c <LIBRARY_NAME>.c
To run:
>gcc main.c numberOfLinesLib.o FNACharactersLib.o queryKmersLib.o levenshteinDistanceLib.o 

Current known bugs: kmer counts over 66 do not work, for some reason it creates kmers in the thousands if over 66.
It is currently slow for actual bacterial FNA Files. A lower kmer number(kmer size) results in a faster program.
