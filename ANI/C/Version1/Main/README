EdwardsLab
==========

Code from the Edwards lab, including bioinformatics, image analysis and more. All this code is created and maintained by folks at Rob Edwards' bioinformatics lab at SDSU.

For more information about the Edwards' lab see http://edwards.sdsu.edu/research.

We use this repository to share our code and data with each other, and with the world.

We make all this code available to everyone to use. If you find errors or bugs please let Rob Edwards know ... see the above URL for contact information.

To run:
Each library in terminal:
>gcc -o <LIBRARY_NAME>.o -c <LIBRARY_NAME>.c
To run:
>gcc main.c numberOfLinesLib.o FNACharactersLib.o queryKmersLib.o levenshteinDistanceLib.o 

Current known bugs: kmer counts over 66 do not work, for some reason it creates kmers in the thousands if over 66.
It is currently slow for actual bacterial FNA Files. A lower kmer number(kmer size) results in a faster program.
