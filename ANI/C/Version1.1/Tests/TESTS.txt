Test Cases

Test Case 1
-----------
Objective: K-mers are accurate from .fna file
Active Input Options: 
const int DATABUFFER2[4096];
const int LINESIZE = 70;
const int KMERSIZE = 5;
const char *FNANAME1 = "5mers.fna";
Expected Result: CTGAT TGATC GATCG ATCGA TCGAT CGATC 
Output: CTGAT TGATC GATCG ATCGA TCGAT CGATC 
Result: Pass

Test Case 2
------------
Objective: K-mer can have wide rage of values
Active Input Options: 
const int DATABUFFER2[4096];
const int LINESIZE = 70;
const int KMERSIZE = 1000;
const char *FNANAME1 = "NC_021215.fna";
const char *FNANAME2 = "NC_022886.fna";
K-mer value of 5, 100 and 1000
Exepcted Result: All k-mers remain same size
Output: k-mers All remain the same. Kmer values of 1000 eventually froze the terminal, probably because of computational power of test computer
Result: Pass with reservation

Test Case 3
------------
Objective: Correct ANI value
Active Input Options:
const int DATABUFFER2[4096];
const int LINESIZE = 70;
const int KMERSIZE = 5;
const char *FNANAME1 = "5mers.fna";
const char *FNANAME2 = "5mers2.fna";
Exepected Result: ANI: 21

Code from the Edwards lab, including bioinformatics, image analysis and more. All this code is created and maintained by folks at Rob Edwards' bioinformatics lab at SDSU.

We use this repository to share our code and data with each other, and with the world.

We make all this code available to everyone to use. If you find errors or bugs please let Rob Edwards know ... see the above URL for contact information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run:
Each library in terminal:
>gcc -o <LIBRARY_NAME>.o -c <LIBRARY_NAME>.c
To run:
>gcc main.c numberOfLinesLib.o FNACharactersLib.o levenshteinDistanceLib.o

Current known bugs: 
1. Kmer values of 1000 eventually froze the terminal, probably because of computational power of test computer
2. I am not sure about what to do when one .fna file is longer than the other. I have implemented a solution that will stop calculating ANI when all respective kmers stop in one of the files
3. Levenshtein Distance calculations are currently slow for large kmer sizes
